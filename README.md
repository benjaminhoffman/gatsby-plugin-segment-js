- YARN: `$ yarn add gatsby-plugin-segment-js`

## How to use

### Setup

In your gatsby-config.js file:

```javascript
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-segment-js`,
    options: {
      // your segment write key for your production environment
      // when process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      // required; non-empty string
      prodKey: 'SEGMENT_PRODUCTION_WRITE_KEY',

      // if you have a development env for your segment account, paste that key here
      // when process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
      // optional; non-empty string
      devKey: 'SEGMENT_DEV_WRITE_KEY',

      // Boolean indicating if you want this plugin to perform any automated analytics.page() calls
      // at all, or not.
      // If set to false, see below on how to track pageviews manually.
      // 
      // This plugin will attempt to intelligently prevent duplicate page() calls.
      // 
      // Default: true
      trackPage: true,

      // Boolean indicating if you want this plugin to perform a page() call immediately once the snippet
      // is loaded.
      // 
      // You might want to disable this if you *only* want page() calls to occur upon Client-side routing
      // updates. See `trackPageOnRouteUpdate` option.
      // 
      // This plugin will still attempt to intelligently prevent duplicate page() calls.
      // 
      // Default: true
      trackPageImmediately: true,

      // Boolean indicating whether to ignore `page` calls by this plugin before we call `analytics.load`
      // and/or the `ready` event has been emitted by `analytics`.
      // 
      // Useful in some cases to prevent issues "queuing" `page` events before Segment is fully loaded.
      trackPageOnlyIfReady: false,

      // Boolean indicating whether to perform any page() calls during Client-side routing updates.
      // 
      // You might want to disable `trackPageImmediately` if you *only* want page() calls to occur upon
      // Client-side routing updates.
      // 
      // This plugin will still attempt to intelligently prevent duplicate page() calls.
      // 
      // Default: true
      trackPageOnRouteUpdate: true,

      // Number indicating what delay (in ms) should be used when calling analytics.page() in response
      // to a Gatsby `onRouteUpdate` event. This can help to ensure that the segment route tracking is 
      // in sync with the actual Gatsby route. Otherwise you can end up in a state where the Segment
      // page tracking reports the previous page on route change.
      // 
      // See https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/ for more information.
      // 
      // Default: 50
      trackPageOnRouteUpdateDelay: 50,

      // Boolean indicating whether or not to add the document.title as the first argument to
      // the analytics.page() calls. Segment uses some san defaults, but some users of this plugin
      // have wanted to do this in the past.
      // 
      // E.g `analytics.page(document.title)`
      // 
      // Default: false
      includeTitleInTrackPage: false,
      
      // Boolean indicating whether to call analytics.load() immediately, or to delay it by a specified
      // number of ms. Can be useful if you want to wait a specifc amount of time before calling
      // analytics.load() and kicking off the activity that occurs with that call.
      // 
      // Default: false
      delayLoad: false,

      // Number indicating (in ms) how long to wait for before analytics.load() will be called if
      // the `delayLoad` option is set to `true`.
      // 
      // Default: 1000
      delayLoadDelay: 1000,

      // Boolean indicating whether to delay calling analytics.load() until either:
      // 1) The User interacts with the page by scrolling
      // OR
      // 2) The User triggers a Gatsby route change.
      // 
      // The `delayLoad` option can be used in addition to this option.
      // 
      // NOTE: 
      // The route change will only be triggered if you leverage client-side routing (ie, Gatsby <Link>)
      // So if you leverage server-side routing with this feature, only a User scroll will trigger
      // the `load` call. This is because client-side routing does not do
      // a full page refresh, but server-side routing does. Therfore server-side routing will never
      // appear to have been triggered by a User interaction.
      // 
      // This is an advanced feature most often used to try to help improve your website's TTI (for SEO, UX, etc).
      //

      // Problem/solution: https://marketingexamples.com/seo/performance
      delayLoadUntilActivity: false,

      // Number indicating (in ms) any additional delay to wait before calling analytics.load()
      // after User "activity" has occurred in conjunction with the `delayLoadUntilActivity` option.
      // 
      // Default: 0
      delayLoadUntilActivityAdditionalDelay: 0,

      // Whether to completely skip calling `analytics.load({writeKey})`.
      // ADVANCED FEATURE: only use if you are calling `analytics.load({writeKey})` manually
      // elsewhere in your code or are using a library
      // like: https://github.com/segmentio/consent-manager that will call it for you.
      // Useful for only loading the tracking script once a user has opted in to being tracked, for example.
      manualLoad: false,

      // If you need to proxy events through a custom endpoint,
      // add a `host` property (defaults to https://cdn.segment.io)
      // Segment docs:
      //   - https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/custom-domains
      //   - https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#proxy
      host: 'https://override-segment-endpoint',

      // This package will use a default version of Segment's code snippet, but
      // if you'd like to include your own you can do so here. This is useful if
      // the version this package uses is different than the one you'd like to
      // use...or you need to do something custom.
      // While you should NOT use a back-ticked template string here, the string
      // will be evaluated as template literal with the following variables
      // available to it:
      //    - `writeKey`: The appropriate value from the `prodKey` and `devKey`
      //      options, based on the `NODE_ENV`
      //    - any of the other options passed here
      // 
      // NOTES: 
      // - If you provide a custom snippet, an immediate call to
      //   `analytics.load()` and/or `analytics.page()` will not be added by
      //   this plugin. You can - of course - add them yourself to your snippet.
      // - If your custom snippet does not include a call to `analytics.load()`
      //   then you must either:
      //   1. Manually load it and set the `manualLoad` option here to `true`
      //   2. Use the `delayLoad` option here
      customSnippet: '!function(){var analytics=window.analytics||[];...;analytics.load("${writeKey}");analytics.page();}}();'
    }
  }
];
```

### Loading

A typical Segment setup using this plugin will add an initial "snippet" for Segment to the page. Once that snippet is there, it needs to be "loaded" completely by making a call to `analytics.load(<your segment key here>)` before it will actually send over any events to Segment. This `load` call causes a flurry of XHR calls, and some people seem to be quite concerned with having those calls not occur until after some delay - usually for SEO scores, though it's not clear to me if the way Segment handles `load` calls will impact TTI, etc. Regardless, if you want this plugin to delay calling `load`, you have 2 options:
    1. `delayLoad`: This will cause a straightforward delay before `load` is called. Use in conjunction with `delayLoadDelay` to tweak the amount of the delay.
    2. `delayLoadUntilActivity`: This will wait to call `load` until __either__ (a) the user triggers a "scroll" event or (b) the user triggers route change. This option will take precendence over the `delayLoad` option.

### Track Events

If you want to track events, you simply invoke Segment as normal in your React components ‚Äî (`window.analytics.track('Event Name', {...})` ‚Äî and you should see the events within your Segment debugger! For example, if you wanted to track events on a click, it may look something like this:

```javascript
class IndexPage extends React.Component {
    ...
    _handleClick() {
        window.analytics.track("Track Event Fired", {
            userId: user.id,
            gender: 'male',
            age: 33,
        });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                <Link onClick={this._handleClick} to="/">
                    Click here
                </Link>{" "}
                to see a track event
            </p>
        );
    }
}
```

### Track Pageviews

If you want to track pageviews automatically, set (or leave) `trackPage` to `true` in your `gatsby-config.js` file. What we mean by _"automatically"_ is that we will intelligently decide how or when to invoke `window.analytics.page()` for you.

This involves identifying if the last `page` call was made while the User was on the same `location.pathname` as the previous `page` call. If they appear to be the same, we will skip the duplicate call.

This plugin can also leverage Gatsby's `onRouteUpdate` API in the `gatsby-browser.js` file ([link][on-route-update]) if you so desire. This is accomplished by setting (or leaving) the `trackPageOnRouteUpdate` to `true`. If this option is enabled, we will make a `page` call every time that the `onRouteUpdate` handler is called. That includes the initial route, and any route changes.

If you only want to use this plugin to inject and load Segment, and not make any `page` calls, this can be done. Just set `trackPage: false`. But then you will have to make `page` calls yourself in your `gatsby-browser.js` file, like this:

```javascript
// gatsby-browser.js
exports.onRouteUpdate = () => {
  window.analytics && window.analytics.page();
};
```
